"""sessions: nullable user_id + add api_key_id + XOR check

Service API keys resolve to a synthetic UserInDB whose id is never inserted
into ``users``. Writing that synthetic id into ``sessions.user_id`` (NOT NULL
FK to ``users.id``) blew up /ask with a ForeignKeyViolationError, surfacing
as a 500 on every question asked through a pk_ service key.

This migration:
1. Drops NOT NULL on ``sessions.user_id`` so service-key sessions can omit it.
2. Adds ``sessions.api_key_id`` (FK to ``api_keys_v2.id``, ON DELETE SET NULL)
   so service-key sessions still have an owning principal recorded for
   ownership checks and audit.
3. Indexes ``api_key_id`` for the ownership-check query path.
4. Enforces the application invariant — exactly one of ``user_id`` /
   ``api_key_id`` is set per row — as a DB CHECK constraint. The ORM mapping
   in ``sessions_table.py`` mirrors the same constraint so model-driven
   setups stay in sync. Without this guard, a future regression in any
   write path (or a manual tweak) could land a NULL/NULL row that is
   invisible to user-scoped listings and dereferences nothing useful.
