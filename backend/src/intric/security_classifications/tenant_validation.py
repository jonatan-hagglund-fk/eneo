"""Helpers for validating tenant-scoped security classification references.

The tenant model routers (completion / embedding / transcription) all need
the same lookup: "given an optional classification id from a request body,
return the UUID if it belongs to this tenant, raise NotFoundException
otherwise". This module is the single home for that lookup so the three
routers stay in sync as the rule evolves (e.g. soft-delete, archived
classifications).
